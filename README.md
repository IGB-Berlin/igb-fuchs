IGB-FUCHS
=========

**<https://fuchs.igb-berlin.de>**

IGB-FUCHS is an Electronic Lab Notebook with a focus on fieldwork, developed at
the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in Berlin.

The name means "fox" in German (a smart animal that knows its way around fields)
and is a backronym for "**F**eld- und **U**mweltdaten-**Ch**eck-**S**ystem".

Alpha Version
-------------

This is an **early alpha testing version** which certainly still contains bugs.

**DATA MAY BE LOST.**
You should always perform regular backups via the "Export" function, **however**,
it is very likely that you will not be able to restore these backups when new versions of this app are released.

As soon as the testing phase is completed and the data format has been stabilized, this message will be updated accordingly.
