=========

**<https://fuchs.igb-berlin.de>**

IGB-FUCHS is an Electronic Lab Notebook with a focus on fieldwork, developed at
the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in Berlin.

The name means "fox" in German (a smart animal that knows its way around fields)
and is a backronym for "**F**eld- und **U**mweltdaten-**Ch**eck-**S**ystem".

Installation on Mobile
----------------------

Please see [the installation instructions](src/images/IGB-FUCHS_Mobile-Installation.pdf).
The installation on mobile devices is useful to ensure the app still works even when there
is no Internet connection.

Beta Version
------------

This is a **beta version** which certainly still contains bugs.

**DATA MAY BE LOST.**
You should always perform regular backups via the "Export" function.

This message will be updated according to the current state of development.
