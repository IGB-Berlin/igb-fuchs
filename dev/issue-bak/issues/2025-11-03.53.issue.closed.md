On mobile, the slider is too close to the edges of the screen and using it may trigger other gestures. Increase the distance of the slider to the bottom and side borders, and make the slider a little bigger. Also, then it makes sense to un-sticky it.

Didn't un-sticky yet b/c it still doesn't take up a ton of vertical space.
