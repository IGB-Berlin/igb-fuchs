When a user has a long "Notes" or similar textarea field expanded on mobile, the field may fill the whole screen, and the field's title will only be "Notes" or not be visible at all. The user may lose context of what they're editing when switching back and forth between apps. Consider including the name of the object being edited in the "Notes" label, and/or perhaps a sticky label?
