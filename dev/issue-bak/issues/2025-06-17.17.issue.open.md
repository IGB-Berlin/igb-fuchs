# [\#17 Issue](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/issues/17) `open`: Better display of list of Sampling Locations?
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `wishlist`

The [current list](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/editors/samp-log.tsx#L108) of Sampling Locations in a Log could be sorted by distance from the current location. This also applies to all other places where locations lists occur, e.g. the From Template dialog (i.e. an improvement on [`listSelectDialog`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/editors/list-dialog.tsx#L24)).

The list of Sampling Locations by distance could even be live updated using the code in [location.ts](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/location.ts#L27) (but that file should also be deleted if I decide against this feature).

Another (very low-priority) idea might be whether it is easily possible to show all sampling locations on a map (at least maybe via a KML export?).
