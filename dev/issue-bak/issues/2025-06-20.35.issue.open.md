The flow of what happens internally when the user uses the "Save & Next ..." slider is documented at the top of [`EditorStack.initNextButton`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/editors/stack.tsx#L219) and is quite complex and "Rube Goldberg". The reason it's so complex is that we need to support the browser's Back button, which means we need to use the browser's `History` object and `popstate` Event, which unfortunately doesn't allow passing state, and causes the whole flow to be dependent on two event callbacks and a separate state variable. I haven't yet found any specific cases where the flow can be interrupted and the state to fall out of sync, but I'm worried there might be such (rare) cases, and I wonder if there's a better way to implement the flow despite the dependence on the event callbacks...
