Some change at or before the refactorings in 5c7929ba58ab5cd9930e9981ac9818f3bb1e26da causes [`HomePage.selfUpdate`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/editors/home.tsx#L59) to get called, which I *think* shouldn't happen. Need to investigate this further.
