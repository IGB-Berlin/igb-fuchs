It would be good if this app could detect running in private windows and [not allow running there](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/c416817b09b2fc2892061b940cc5723544d7b618/src/dialogs.tsx#L24) because private windows make it very easy to accidentally close them and lose all data.

I had been hoping that my [`IdbStorage.selfTest`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/c416817b09b2fc2892061b940cc5723544d7b618/src/idb-store.ts#L449) would detect this case, but it doesn't.
