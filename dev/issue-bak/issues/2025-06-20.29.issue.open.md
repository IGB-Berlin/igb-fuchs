# [\#29 Issue](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/issues/29) `open`: Consider making completed Samples' Measurements harder to edit?
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `wishlist`

When a Sample has had all of its Measurements entered, and the Sample is saved and closed, I could consider *not* [using `MeasListEditor`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/7d375f11106da7836486ee650a9af57fd41aedd4/src/editors/sample.tsx#L116) anymore when re-opening that Sample later, to prevent accidental edits? (alternative: making the [`MiniMeasEditor`s](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/7d375f11106da7836486ee650a9af57fd41aedd4/src/editors/meas-list.tsx#L33) readonly)

I don't think my code can currently distinguish whether a [`Sample.template`'s](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/7d375f11106da7836486ee650a9af57fd41aedd4/src/types/sample.ts#L69) [`measurementTypes`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/7d375f11106da7836486ee650a9af57fd41aedd4/src/types/sample.ts#L149) have all been finished or whether it never had any planned `measurementTypes` to begin with, so I might need a change to the data model first to support something like this. Though maybe the easier route is to *only* use `MeasListEditor` when there are template items left... need to think about it some more.
Another thing to check and consider: In some cases, when creating a new object from scratch, without a template, I think its `template` field (`this.initObj.template`?) is still initialized to an empty template?
