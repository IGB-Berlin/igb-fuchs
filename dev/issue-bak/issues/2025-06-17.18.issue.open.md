The [auto-expansion](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/editors/base.tsx#L428) of an input row with a text area seems to have been broken by one of the refactorings, probably sometime not too long before cb9ead6987a62c7a2b04a53ca5fec363242d6fcd.
