Sometimes, there might be Sampling Locations that are used only for the purpose of navigation (e.g. hard-to-find entrances to parks/forests/etc.); for these, the copying of `commonSamples` could be omitted. Could be configured by a new checkbox "no samples" and a corresponding field in `ISamplingProcedure`. (The checkbox could be hidden somewhat in the UI to prevent accidental usage?)
