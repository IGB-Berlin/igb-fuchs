Sampling Location Templates used to warn when the template contained no samples, but that warning was kind of annoying when building a Sampling Procedure with `commonSamples`, but implementing that exception would mean that the Location needs access to the Procedure to check. Because that was a bit complex, the warning is currently entirely disabled, which isn't great either.

Perhaps the warning needs to be implemented in the Procedure Template instead?
