Currently, I need to pass the [`ListEditor` constructors](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/editors/list-edit.tsx#L139) both the child [`Editor`'s `EditorClass`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/editors/base.tsx#L52) and a [`StyleValue`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/types/common.ts#L40), even though the two are always directly linked in that the `StyleValue` is a static property on the class of the object that the `Editor` is editing. For example: `new ListEditorWithTemp(..., SamplingLocationEditor, SamplingLocation.sStyle, ...)` where `class SamplingLocationEditor extends Editor<SamplingLocation>`.

I think it'd be nice if there was a type-safe way to combine the two, though I'm not yet sure if TypeScript has support for this because the style is a static property and I've had to work around that through the [`style` accessor](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/types/common.ts#L70).
