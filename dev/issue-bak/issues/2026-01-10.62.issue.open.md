I'm pretty sure that [`makeRow`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/90017fa964a87852d52c0b6ea1590ed097426d03/src/editors/base.tsx#L386), [`makeNameHelp`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/90017fa964a87852d52c0b6ea1590ed097426d03/src/editors/base.tsx#L420), [`makeTextAreaRow`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/90017fa964a87852d52c0b6ea1590ed097426d03/src/editors/base.tsx#L430), and [`makeAccordion`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/90017fa964a87852d52c0b6ea1590ed097426d03/src/editors/base.tsx#L480) can be made `static`, or probably better, moved to a separate utility function file.

Also, I think [`EditorClass`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/90017fa964a87852d52c0b6ea1590ed097426d03/src/editors/base.tsx#L60) is only used to construct new objects of the class, so it could perhaps be turned into a "callable" that returns a new object (though now that I think about it, I'm not sure that really makes a difference).
