Sampling Logs keep track of their [Last Modified timestamp](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/1fd8ef295928e7b3ace4436f6f92495fbc735374/src/types/sampling.ts#L35), while Sampling Procedures currently [do not](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/1fd8ef295928e7b3ace4436f6f92495fbc735374/src/types/sampling.ts#L180), which means that on export, we have to use the [current date and time](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/0d7f527e118d53dcfd9b2d167b8cb50c9410be3d/src/idb-store.ts#L108), which makes versioning of the files a little harder for users. Could add a `lastModified` field to `ISamplingProcedure` as well.
