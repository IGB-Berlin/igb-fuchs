# [\#3 Issue](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/issues/3) `closed`: Form validation should also trigger an alert box

When clicking "Save & Close" at the bottom of the page, the input boxes at the top of the page causing the validation failure are not always visible, so it's confusing because it seems like the button didn't work without visual feedback.
