There are several fields that are candidates to be hidden in a dropdown or accordion:
- Start and End Time when they're automatically set (i.e. objects from templates)
- Sampling Log's Checklist when all items are complete
- Perhaps from #36: Nominal & Actual Coordinates (though that might make more sense in a separate dropdown/accordion)
- The "No Samples" checkbox idea from #7
