**Labels**: `enhancement`, `wishlist`

Currently, checks for duplicates ([example](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/types/location.ts#L98)) are only run on the "other" objects contained in their parents, when they could also check for duplicates against the [global templates](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/idb-store.ts#L306C26-L314C45), for example.

I also haven't put enough thought into duplicate checking in general, and on which objects it makes sense and to what level (e.g. are two Measurement Types different if their only difference is their max value?).

I need to overhaul the duplicate checking in general for all objects.
