**Labels**: `enhancement`, `wishlist`

Currently, checks for duplicates ([example](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/types/location.ts#L98)) are only run on the "other" objects contained in their parents, when they could also check for duplicates against the [global templates](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/idb-store.ts#L306C26-L314C45), for example.

I also haven't put enough thought into duplicate checking in general, and on which objects it makes sense and to what level (e.g. are two Measurement Types different if their only difference is their max value?).

This also applies to deduplication of the templates offered via [`ListEditorTemp`'s `templateSource` argument](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/editors/list-edit.tsx#L272) ([example](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/editors/samp-log.tsx#L108)): Should that use a less strict version of our `equals` method to filter out *more* templates ([`setRemove`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/types/set.ts#L48)), or should we do *less* filtering or none at all, e.g. if a user intentionally wants to have multiple measurements on the same type, which might be relevant to the thoughts in #8?

I need to overhaul the duplicate checking in general for all objects.
