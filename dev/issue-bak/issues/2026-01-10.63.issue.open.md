This issue is for tracking improvements to the "Import from WTW® devices" feature (implemented in #58).

- At the moment, when pressing `PRT` while no Sample is open, nothing happens at all, because [the code](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/90017fa964a87852d52c0b6ea1590ed097426d03/src/wtw.tsx#L72) relies on event listeners being registered, and it doesn't know when none are connected, and so it can't raise a warning in this case. ([prepared test case](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/7431fdd87aec5eb02392cf88928626a08c16ee06/src/__tests__/400-wtw.test.ts#L252))
- I need to test this against more outputs from WTW devices. For example, I currently don't know:
  - Can any of the measurements ever be reported in scientific notation? ([reference](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/9e15fb901f9708aaed7201525091247185c694e2/src/wtw-parse.ts#L53))
  - Can EC ever be reported in mS/cm? ([reference](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/9e15fb901f9708aaed7201525091247185c694e2/src/wtw-parse.ts#L60))
