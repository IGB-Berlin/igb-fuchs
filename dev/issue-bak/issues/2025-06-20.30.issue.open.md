The `MiniMeasEditor`'s [input](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/7d375f11106da7836486ee650a9af57fd41aedd4/src/editors/meas-list.tsx#L47) sometimes wraps in an ugly way when there are long Measurement Type names such as "Sauerstoffs√§ttigung", so we could use the abbreviation list suggested in #10 for this as well.

Also, the minimum width of the input box is not enough.
