When using the app on a mobile device in the field, it is much less likely the users will be typing coordinates, instead they will only be using the "Navigate To" and "Use Current Coordinates" buttons. Therefore, the two fields "Nominal Coordinates" and "Actual Coordinates" could be hidden by default (e.g. in a dropdown/accordion) and only two buttons "Navigate To Nominal Coordinates" and "Set Actual Coordinates to Current Coordinates" shown.
