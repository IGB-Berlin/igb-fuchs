A common workflow in the field is that a water sample is taken at one Location, the measurement equipment measures that sample in the car while driving to the next Location, and the Measurement values are then recorded upon arrival at the second Location. So it would be nice if there was a "Navigate to Next Location" button or link on the (last) Sample of a Location to facilitate this.

This would probably need to be implemented via the [`EditorStack`'s "Next" feature](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/7d375f11106da7836486ee650a9af57fd41aedd4/src/editors/stack.tsx#L224), because that's currently the one place where [`nextButtonText`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/7d375f11106da7836486ee650a9af57fd41aedd4/src/editors/base.tsx#L69) is accessed and the associated logic is handled.
