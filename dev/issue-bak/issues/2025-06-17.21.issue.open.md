I've noticed that sometimes, in Chrome on Android, the "Export All" button only works once until the page is reloaded. I need to investigate this further.

Reference: [`makeImportExport`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/import-export.tsx#L56)

Confirmed the behavior is still present on FUCHS v0.1.0-beta on Chrome+Android, not on Chrome Desktop though, so it may be an Android thing. And the bug doesn't just affect "Export All", it affects all exports!
