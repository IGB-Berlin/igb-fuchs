When creating a Log/Location/Sample from scratch, each of them is initialized with a `template` field that is not really valid e.g. because their `name` properties are empty, they also clutter the resulting JSON file. I think that these empty templates should not be being generated; the `template` field can remain `null`/nonexistent.
