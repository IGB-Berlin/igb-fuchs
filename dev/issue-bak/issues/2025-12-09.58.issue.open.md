The work on supporting reading from a WTW® measurement device (3430 or 3630) is already currently underway in the [`wtw` branch](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/tree/wtw).

I need to test this against more outputs from WTW devices. For example, I currently don't know:

- Can any of the measurements ever be reported in scientific notation? ([reference](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/9e15fb901f9708aaed7201525091247185c694e2/src/wtw-parse.ts#L53))
- Can EC ever be reported in mS/cm? ([reference](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/9e15fb901f9708aaed7201525091247185c694e2/src/wtw-parse.ts#L60))

TODO bugfix: When a sample is not yet saved, and measurements are imported, this currently results in the error "selfUpdate not allowed when not yet saved".

Also add an auto retry after the first connection failure

TODO: What if [a `WtwDataReceivedEvent` is received by `SampleEditor`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/633423087b7d71191397fc0938043a8632288f0e/src/editors/sample.tsx#L125), but that editor is actually not currently visible because there's a `MeasurementEditor` on top?
