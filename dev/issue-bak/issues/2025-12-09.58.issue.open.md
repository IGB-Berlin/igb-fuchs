The work on supporting reading from a WTW® measurement device (3430 or 3630) is already currently underway in the [`wtw` branch](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/tree/wtw).

I need to test this against more outputs from WTW devices. For example, I currently don't know:

- Can any of the measurements ever be reported in scientific notation? ([reference](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/9e15fb901f9708aaed7201525091247185c694e2/src/wtw-parse.ts#L53))
- Can EC ever be reported in mS/cm? ([reference](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/9e15fb901f9708aaed7201525091247185c694e2/src/wtw-parse.ts#L60))
