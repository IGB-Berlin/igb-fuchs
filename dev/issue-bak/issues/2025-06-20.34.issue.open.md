**Describe the bug**
An error message when clicking "Save & Close" such as `Error: i=3 stack.length=3 link=...` but the application continues working afterwards.

**For users:** This error can be safely ignored. A workaround is to click somewhere else on the page before clicking "Save & Close".

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to a Sample with at least one Measurement.
2. Enter the measurement values so there are no warnings or errors.
3. Click on "Subjective Quality: Questionable" or "Bad" so that the "Save & Close" button turns yellow.
4. Click in the Notes field and enter text.
5. *Without* clicking anywhere else, i.e. while the "Save & Close" button is still yellow, click on the yellow "Save & Close" button.
6. The error message occurs.

There are other workflows that can trigger this error as well, such as adding a new Measurement Type to a Sample Template and entering all fields except Notes and then directly clicking on the yellow "Save & Close". The above workflow is probably one of the most common.

**Internal Notes**
I believe this might have something to do with either events firing out of order or two different things triggering the same event.

The source of the error is [this assertion in `EditorStack.restyleNavbar`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/editors/stack.tsx#L89).

There are currently quite a few "Workaround for stack bug" lines in [`50full.play.ts`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/f48291113678ccfe4714f12935373919cb45a338/src/__tests__/50full.play.ts#L396) that move the focus away from the input field and that can be removed when this bug is fixed.
