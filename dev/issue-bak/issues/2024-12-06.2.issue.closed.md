Update
------

This is a problem with the Samsung keyboard. The best solution is to install a different keyboard (e.g. Google, SwiftKey, or many more).

A workaround is now also available: You can press the "." (dot/period) button twice to get a minus sign.

This appears to be specific to the Samsung keyboard: <https://stackoverflow.com/q/21677695>, which suggests `<input type="text" inputmode="numeric">`
