Sometimes, there are samples that need to be taken repeatedly, e.g. hourly/daily samples. This could be supported via a "repeated sample" checkbox with a corresponding option in the `ISampleTemplate` so that such templates are not removed when they are "Started".

Reference: Probably [`ListEditorWithTemp`](https://github.com/IGB-Berlin/igb-fuchs/blob/fe59b397704ecc4fab12d395512ee4f8d7655b66/src/editors/list-edit.tsx#L325)

Actually, instead of a simple boolean, this setting could be a count of how many times it should be repeated.
