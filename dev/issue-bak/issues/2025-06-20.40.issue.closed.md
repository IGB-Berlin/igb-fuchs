There are several fields that are candidates to be hidden in a dropdown or accordion:
- Start and End Time when they're automatically set (i.e. objects from templates) *Update:* Done in ce0adedbd4f3acb5b753ee2d93d532819e687ca1
- Sampling Log's Checklist when all items are complete *Update:* Done in 8579490d0626a170ea20721734369a8b3fe9e41a
- ~~Perhaps from #36: Nominal & Actual Coordinates (though that might make more sense in a separate dropdown/accordion)~~ *Update:* Yes, that made more sense separately.
- The "No Samples" checkbox idea from #7 *Update:* Mentioned in that issue
