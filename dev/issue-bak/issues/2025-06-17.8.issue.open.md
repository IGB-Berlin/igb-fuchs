Sometimes, multiple measurements of the same type are taken to have an average (e.g. soil moisture with a handheld probe, might be used on three different locations in the soil within a few centimeters of one another). When there are only a few measurements, users can currently solve this with multiple measurements with slightly different names ("Temp1", "Temp2", "Temp3"), but it's also worth considering whether the app could accept multiple measurement values natively.

In the simplest form this could be `Measurement.value` accepting a semicolon-separated list of values of which an average is reported in the CSV export, though of course if this feature is needed often it would make sense to implement this more cleanly - i.e. allow storing a list of values, and provide a good UI for data entry.

(I also previously considered providing an "average calculator" in the app, but we should encourage the storing of all raw data instead of averages.)
